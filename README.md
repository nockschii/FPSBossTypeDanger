## Problems and Challenges
Challenges:
- find a suiteable game logic (wasn't sure until the very end)
- enemy ai (wanted enemy to be able to do more (waypaths, shooting, etc))
- creating animations and audio sources correctly
- time limit

Problems:
- weapon animation still bugged
- game logic is not completed due to time limitation
- Due to the fact that I wasn't sure what my game logic will be I wasn't able to complete game logic in the end (I am satisfied though given the time limitation)
- didn't consider resolution at all (is there a trick?)

[FPS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fGB2H1AGP8&list=PLZ1b66Z1KFKh-auyvzNkOBFLWf6dH6iEH) - watched and used some of it, but there were things I wanted to do like the first person controller, that's why I did not use a prefab e.g. I watched like the first 5-6 episodes

## Self Assessment

### working game build, overall impression is it a game? (5)
- I think I did quite well, I can say it's a game. Even though I 
had some experience with Unity, I can say it is quite challenging
because you forget so much and because of the time limitation.

### project structure (3.5)
- I am not really satisfied with my project structure, had to do with my unsureness about the game logic
and the time limitation

### documentation (5)
- I think my documentation is fine: 5

### features (4.1)
- I think I used all of those features but maybe I could get more out of it, but I was interested in other stuff too.
- Materials: 0.8
