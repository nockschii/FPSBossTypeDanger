## Time Spent report

## Problems and Challenges
Challenges:
- find a suiteable game logic (wasn't sure until the very end)
- enemy ai (wanted enemy to be able to do more (waypaths, shooting, etc))
- creating animations and audio sources correctly
- time limit

Problems:
- weapon animation still bugged
- game logic is not completed due to time limitation
- Due to the fact that I wasn't sure what my game logic will be I wasn't able to complete game logic in the end (I am satisfied though given the time limitation)
- didn't consider resolution at all (is there a trick?)

## Self Assessment
- I think I did quite well, I can say it's a game. Even though I 
had some experience with Unity, I can say it is quite challenging
because you forget so much and because of the time limitation.
